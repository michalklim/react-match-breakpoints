## Motivation

React Match Breakpoints **(RMB)** goal is to provide a consistent way of handling responsiveness in your application.
Though similar in some ways to other solutions like [react-responsive](https://github.com/contra/react-responsive) or [react-media](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-media)
RMB differs in core concepts:

- You should be able to use RMB with ease in any given form (as component, hoc or hook).
  Regardless of how you will be using RMB, your breakpoints configuration should be single source of thruth.

- RMB should make no assumptions regarding how you media queries should look like.
  RMB is built on top of [matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) API so you can pass any media query
  string. This approach gives you a lot of flexibility and works great with CSS-in-JS solutions since
  you can declare your media queries once and use them both in your styles and layout.
